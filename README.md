# Data Scraping from Website with Python and Beautiful Soup

## Summary
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a real website, specifically targeting a table on Wikipedia, using Python and Beautiful Soup library. The scraped data is then organized into a Pandas data frame and exported to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Methodology
Introduction to Web Scraping: The project starts with an overview of web scraping and its importance in data collection from real-world sources.

Library Import: Necessary libraries, including Beautiful Soup and Requests, are imported to facilitate the scraping process.

URL Retrieval and Request Making: The URL of the target webpage is obtained, and a request is made to fetch its HTML content.

Creating Soup Object and HTML Parsing: The HTML content is parsed using Beautiful Soup to create a soup object, enabling easy navigation and extraction of data.

Webpage Inspection: The webpage structure is inspected to identify the desired table for scraping.

Table Identification: Using Beautiful Soup's find or find_all functions, the target table is located within the HTML document.

Header Extraction: The headers of the table are extracted using find or find_all functions, typically in conjunction with the th tags.

Data Extraction and DataFrame Creation: Data from each row of the table is extracted using find_all function with the td tags, and then appended to a Pandas data 
frame.

Exporting to CSV: The data frame containing the scraped data is exported to a CSV file using the to_csv function, with an option to exclude the index.

## Key Insights
Scraping Process Overview: The scraping process involves importing libraries, making a request to the website, creating a soup object, identifying the desired table, and extracting the data.

Header Extraction: The headers of the table can be extracted using find or find_all functions in conjunction with the th tags.

Data Extraction and DataFrame Handling: Data from each row can be extracted using find_all function with the td tags, and then appended to the data frame, facilitating easy manipulation and analysis.

CSV Export: The data frame can be exported to a CSV file using the to_csv function, allowing for further processing or sharing of the scraped data.

Error Handling: It is crucial to handle unexpected issues that may arise during the scraping process, such as incorrect table selection or missing data.

Accessibility for Beginners: The project provides a step-by-step guide and explanations for each stage of the scraping process, making it accessible for beginners.

Ease of Data Manipulation: The use of Pandas data frame enables straightforward manipulation and analysis of the scraped data, enhancing its usability for downstream tasks.
